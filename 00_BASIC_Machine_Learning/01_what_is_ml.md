# **What is Machine Learning?**  

Machine Learning (ML) is a type of **artificial intelligence (AI)** that lets computers **learn from data** and make **predictions** or **decisions** **without being explicitly programmed**.  

### **How Does It Work?**  
1. **Data Input** → The computer gets lots of examples (like pictures, numbers, or text).  
2. **Learning (Training)** → The computer finds **patterns** in the data.  
3. **Prediction** → After learning, it can guess answers for new, unseen data!  

### **Types of ML**
- **Supervised Learning** → Learns from **labeled data** (like a teacher showing answers).  
  - Example: Predicting house prices.  
- **Unsupervised Learning** → Finds hidden patterns in **unlabeled data**.  
  - Example: Grouping similar customers.  
- **Reinforcement Learning** → Learns by **trial & error** (like a video game AI).  
  - Example: Self-driving cars.  

### **Why is ML Cool?**  
- Helps in **medicine** (detecting diseases early).  
- Powers **voice assistants** (like Siri & Alexa).  
- Improves **recommendations** (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify).  

### **In Short:**  
ML = **Computers learning from data to make smart decisions!**
