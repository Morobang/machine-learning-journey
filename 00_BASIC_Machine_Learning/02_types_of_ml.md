# **Types of Machine Learning**  

Machine Learning (ML) can be divided into **three main types**, based on how the system learns from data:  

### **1. Supervised Learning **  
- Learns from **labeled data** (input-output pairs).  
- Goal: **Predict outcomes** for new, unseen data.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **House Price Prediction** (input: house features → output: price)  
  - **Spam Detection** (input: email → output: spam or not spam)  
- **Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks.  

### **2. Unsupervised Learning **  
- Learns from **unlabeled data** (no correct answers given).  
- Goal: **Find hidden patterns** or group similar data.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Customer Segmentation** (grouping shoppers by behavior)  
  - **Image Clustering** (grouping similar photos automatically)  
- **Algorithms:** K-Means, PCA, Apriori.  

### **3. Reinforcement Learning **  
- Learns by **trial & error** (like training a pet).  
- Gets **rewards** for good actions & **penalties** for bad ones.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Self-Driving Cars** (learning to navigate safely)  
  - **AI Playing Games** (Chess, Go, Dota 2)  
- **Algorithms:** Q-Learning, Deep Q Networks (DQN).  

### **Bonus: Other Types**  
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**  → Mix of labeled & unlabeled data.  
- **Transfer Learning** → Uses knowledge from one task to solve another.

### **Quick Summary**  
| Type | Data Used | Goal | Example |  
|------|-----------|------|---------|  
| **Supervised**  | Labeled | Predict | Spam Detection |  
| **Unsupervised**  | Unlabeled | Find Patterns | Customer Groups |  
| **Reinforcement**  | Rewards/Penalties | Learn Actions | Game AI |
