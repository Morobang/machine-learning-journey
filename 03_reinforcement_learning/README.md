# üéÆ Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Unlike supervised learning, there are no pre-labeled correct answers - the agent must learn through trial and error.

## üéØ What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning is inspired by how humans and animals learn through interaction with their environment. The key components are:

- **Agent**: The learner or decision maker
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
- **Actions**: Choices available to the agent
- **Rewards**: Feedback signals (positive or negative)
- **State**: Current situation of the agent
- **Policy**: Strategy for choosing actions

## üîÑ How RL Works

1. **Agent observes** the current state of the environment
2. **Agent takes an action** based on its current policy
3. **Environment provides feedback** in the form of a reward/penalty
4. **Agent updates** its strategy based on the outcome
5. **Process repeats** until optimal behavior is learned

### 1. **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**
- **File**: `01_upper_confidence_bound.ipynb`
- **Concept**: Balances exploration and exploitation using confidence intervals
- **Approach**: Selects actions with highest upper confidence bound
- **Use Case**: Multi-armed bandit problems, online advertising, clinical trials
- **Key Feature**: Optimistic approach - tries actions with uncertain outcomes

### 2. **Thompson Sampling**
- **File**: `02_thompson_sampling.ipynb`
- **Concept**: Bayesian approach using probability distributions
- **Approach**: Samples from posterior distributions to choose actions
- **Use Case**: A/B testing, recommendation systems, resource allocation
- **Key Feature**: Probabilistic approach - naturally handles uncertainty

## üìÅ Dataset

- **`ads_ctr_optimization.csv`**: Online advertising click-through rates
  - Simulates multi-armed bandit scenario
  - 10 different ads (arms) to choose from
  - Goal: Maximize total clicks over time
  - Demonstrates exploration vs exploitation trade-off

## üé≤ Multi-Armed Bandit Problem

Both algorithms solve the classic **multi-armed bandit problem**:
- Imagine a casino with multiple slot machines (bandits)
- Each machine has unknown payout rates
- Goal: Maximize total winnings over time
- Challenge: Balance trying new machines (exploration) vs playing the best known machine (exploitation)
