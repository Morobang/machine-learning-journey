- **Health Categories**: Classify users into BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese)
- **Personalized Insights**: Provide health recommendations based on BMI results
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts showing BMI trends and comparisons
- **Health Tracking**: Store and track BMI history over time
- **Educational Content**: Information about BMI and healthy lifestyle tips

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Web Development**: Learn Streamlit for rapid web app development
2. **Health Analytics**: Implement BMI calculations and health categorization
3. **User Experience**: Design intuitive interface with interactive elements
4. **Data Persistence**: Store user data and track changes over time
5. **Educational Value**: Provide valuable health information and insights

## 🔍 Key Features to Implement
- User-friendly input forms for height and weight
- Real-time BMI calculation and category display
- Visual BMI meter/gauge showing current status
- Historical BMI tracking with charts
- Health recommendations based on BMI category
- Comparison with population averages
- Export functionality for personal records

## 📊 BMI Categories & Calculations

### BMI Formula
```
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²
```

### Health Categories
| BMI Range | Category | Health Risk |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| < 18.5 | Underweight | Increased |
| 18.5 - 24.9 | Normal weight | Minimal |
| 25.0 - 29.9 | Overweight | Increased |
| 30.0 - 34.9 | Obesity Class I | High |
| 35.0 - 39.9 | Obesity Class II | Very High |
| ≥ 40.0 | Obesity Class III | Extremely High |
