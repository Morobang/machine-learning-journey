# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 trends using real-world data to understand the pandemic's impact across different regions and time periods. We'll use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib/seaborn for creating compelling visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source**: Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Data Repository
- **Coverage**: Global data from January 2020 onwards
- **Metrics**: Confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing data
- **Granularity**: Country-level and regional data with daily updates

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in case growth, mortality, and recovery rates
2. **Geographic Insights**: Compare pandemic impact across different countries/regions
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Track the progression of the pandemic over time
4. **Vaccination Impact**: Analyze the relationship between vaccination rates and case trends
5. **Interactive Visualizations**: Create engaging charts that tell the story of the pandemic

## 🔍 Key Questions to Answer
- How did case numbers evolve globally over time?
- Which countries were most/least affected?
- What was the relationship between cases and deaths?
- How effective were different intervention measures?
- What impact did vaccines have on case trends?
- Are there seasonal patterns in case numbers?
