# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival patterns and factors that influenced their chances of survival.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Source**: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- **Size**: 891 passengers (training data)
- **Features**: 12 columns including passenger class, age, sex, fare, etc.
- **Target**: Survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive)

## 🎯 Project Objectives
1. **Data Understanding**: Explore the structure and quality of the dataset
2. **Survival Analysis**: Identify key factors that influenced passenger survival
3. **Statistical Insights**: Discover patterns and correlations in the data
4. **Data Visualization**: Create compelling charts to tell the story
5. **Business Insights**: Provide actionable insights for maritime safety

## 🔍 Key Questions to Answer
- What was the overall survival rate?
- How did passenger class affect survival chances?
- Did gender play a role in survival?
- How did age distribution vary among survivors?
- What was the relationship between fare and survival?
- Which embarkation port had the highest survival rate?
