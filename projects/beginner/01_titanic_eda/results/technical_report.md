## üîß Technical Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# Missing Value Treatment
- Age: Median imputation by Pclass + Sex groups
- Embarked: Mode imputation (Southampton)
- Cabin: Converted to binary HasCabin feature

# Feature Engineering
- FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1
- IsAlone = (FamilySize == 1)
- Title extraction from Name using regex
- AgeGroup binning: Child, Teen, Adult, Middle Age, Senior
- FareGroup quartile binning
```

### 2. Statistical Analysis Framework
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Central tendency, dispersion, distribution shape
- **Inferential Statistics**: Chi-square tests for independence (Œ± = 0.05)
- **Effect Size Calculation**: Cram√©r's V for categorical associations
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for survival rate estimates

### 3. Visualization Strategy
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms, bar charts, box plots
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Cross-tabulations, grouped bar charts
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Heatmaps, faceted plots
- **Interactive Components**: Plotly for enhanced exploration

## üîç Advanced Insights

### Interaction Effects
1. **Gender √ó Class**: First-class women had 96.8% survival rate vs 13.0% for third-class men
2. **Age √ó Class**: Children in first class had 100% survival vs 34.1% for children in third class
3. **Family Size √ó Class**: Optimal family size varies by class (2-3 for higher classes, 1-2 for third class)

### Survival Probability Patterns
```
Highest Risk Groups:
- Third-class adult males: 8.5% survival rate
- Large families (5+) in third class: 4.2% survival rate
- Adult males without cabin info: 12.3% survival rate

Highest Survival Groups:
- First-class women: 96.8% survival rate
- Children in first/second class: 100%/100% survival rate
- Women with cabin information: 88.7% survival rate
```

- **Distribution Analysis**: Target variable balanced enough for modeling (38.4% positive class)

## üéØ Recommendations for Model Development

### Algorithm Selection Priority
1. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model, interpretable coefficients
2. **Random Forest**: Handle non-linear relationships, feature importance
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Optimize for accuracy, handle interactions
4. **SVM**: Alternative for comparison, good with medium datasets

### Cross-Validation Strategy
- **Method**: Stratified K-Fold (k=5)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
- **Feature Selection**: Recursive Feature Elimination with CV
