# **Machine Learning Terms – Simple Glossary**

This is a list of common Machine Learning words you’ll hear again and again.
Think of this as your **ML dictionary for beginners**.
No complicated definitions – just plain English.

---

## **Algorithm**

A set of steps or rules that a computer follows to learn patterns from data.

**Example:** Linear Regression is an algorithm that finds a straight line through data points.

---

## **Model**

The result you get after training an algorithm on data.
It’s like a **smart formula** that can make predictions.

---

## **Dataset**

A table of data that has **rows** (examples) and **columns** (features).

---

## **Features**

The input columns of your data that describe something.
Also called **variables** or **X**.

**Example:** In a dataset of houses:

* Size, Location, Bedrooms = Features

---

## **Labels / Target**

The answer or outcome you want to predict.
Also called **y**.

**Example:**
House Price = Label

---

## **Training Data**

Data used to **teach** the model.

---

## **Testing Data**

Data the model has **never seen before**.
We use it to check if the model actually learned or just memorized.

---

## **Supervised Learning**

When the data **already has answers (labels)** and the model tries to learn the relationship.

---

## **Unsupervised Learning**

When the data **has no answers (no labels)** and the model tries to find patterns or groups.

---

## **Overfitting**

When a model becomes too smart on training data (memorizes it) but fails on new data.
Like memorizing answers instead of understanding.

---

## **Underfitting**

When a model is too simple and **doesn’t learn enough patterns**.

---

## **Accuracy**

A score showing how many predictions the model got correct.

---

## **Precision and Recall** (in simple words)

* **Precision:** Of all the predictions I said were correct, how many were actually correct?
* **Recall:** Of all the correct answers, how many did I find?

---

## **Regression**

A type of ML where we predict **numbers** (continuous values).

Example: Predicting house prices.

---

## **Classification**

A type of ML where we predict **categories**.

Example: Spam email or Not Spam email.

---

## **Clustering**

Grouping data into clusters (groups) without having any labels.
Example: Grouping customers by buying habits.

---

## **Evaluation Metric**

A way to measure how good your model is.
Example: Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE).

---

## **Hyperparameters**

Special settings that you choose before training a model.
They control how the model learns.

---

## **Model Training**

The process of teaching the model using training data.

---

## **Model Prediction**

Once trained, the model uses **new data** to make guesses or predictions.

---

## **Pipeline**

A sequence of steps to process data and train a model.
Like an assembly line.

Every time I come across a new term, I’ll add it here.
