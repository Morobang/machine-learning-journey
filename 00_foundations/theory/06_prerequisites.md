# **What You Should Know Before Starting (Prerequisites)**

This series is part of my **Machine Learning learning journey**.
I’m focusing mainly on **understanding ML models** – how they work, how to train them, and how to evaluate them.

> ⚠️ This is NOT a full Data Science course.
> Data cleaning, feature engineering, and other heavy data prep steps are not the main focus here.
> If you already know some **data analysis**, it will help a lot!

## **1. A Bit of Python Programming**

You need to be comfortable with **basic Python**:

* Variables, loops, if/else
* Functions
* Lists and dictionaries
* Using Jupyter Notebook

Why Python?
Because almost every ML library is built for Python!

If you’re new, try **free Python for Data Science tutorials** on Kaggle or YouTube.

## **2. Some Math Basics (Don’t Worry Too Much)**

You don’t need advanced math, just the basics:

* A little **algebra** (how to work with formulas)
* A little **statistics** (mean, median, variance)
* A basic idea of **probability** (chance of something happening)

I will **explain concepts in simple terms** whenever we need them.

## **3. Data Analysis Skills Help**

Since this series doesn’t focus much on cleaning data:

* If you already know how to use **pandas** and **Excel** to explore and analyze data, that’s a plus.
* If not, you can still follow along — I will try to keep the data ready.

---

## **4. Tools You’ll Need**

* **Python 3**
* **Jupyter Notebook** (comes with Anaconda or can be installed separately)
* **Some basic GitHub knowledge** (just enough to download or upload files)

Optional:

* A code editor like **VS Code**

---

## **What You DON’T Need to Worry About**

* You don’t need to be a math genius
* You don’t need to know deep learning or advanced statistics
* You don’t need big data tools

We will **start simple, use ready-made datasets, and focus on models**.

---

## **Key Takeaways**

* This journey = **learning models and how they work**
* Knowing data analysis first will make it easier, but it’s not required
* We will learn by practicing!

---

## **Quick Questions to Ask Yourself**

* Have you ever written a small Python script?
* Do you know what a dataset (rows and columns) looks like?
* Are you ready to learn by doing? (If yes, you’re good to go!)
