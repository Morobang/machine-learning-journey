# 🎯 Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups similar data points together without knowing the correct answers beforehand. It's one of the most intuitive and widely-used approaches in data analysis.

## 🔍 What is Clustering?

Clustering algorithms analyze data to find natural groupings or "clusters" based on similarity. The goal is to maximize similarity within clusters while maximizing differences between clusters.

## 📊 Algorithms in This Section

### 1. **K-Means Clustering**
- **File**: `01_k_means_clustering.ipynb`
- **Concept**: Partitioning data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster distances
- **Approach**: Iteratively assigns points to nearest centroid and updates centroids
- **Use Case**: Customer segmentation, market research, image segmentation
- **Key Feature**: Requires you to specify the number of clusters (k) in advance

### 2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **File**: `02_hierarchical_clustering.ipynb`
- **Concept**: Building a tree-like structure of clusters (dendrogram)
- **Approach**: Either merge small clusters (agglomerative) or split large clusters (divisive)
- **Use Case**: Understanding cluster relationships, when number of clusters is unknown
- **Key Feature**: Creates a hierarchy showing how clusters relate to each other

## 📁 Dataset

- **`mall_customers.csv`**: Customer data with features like age, income, and spending score
  - Perfect for understanding customer segmentation
  - Demonstrates real-world clustering applications
  - Contains both demographic and behavioral data

## 🔄 Learning Progression

1. **Start with K-Means**: 
   - Learn the fundamental concepts of clustering
   - Understand centroids and cluster assignment
   - Practice with the Elbow Method for choosing k

2. **Explore Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - Learn about dendrograms and cluster trees
   - Understand different linkage methods
   - Compare results with K-Means

3. **Compare and Contrast**:
   - Understand when to use each algorithm
   - Analyze the trade-offs between methods
   - Practice interpreting cluster results

## 📏 Key Evaluation Metrics

- **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)**: Measures cluster compactness
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well-separated clusters are (-1 to 1, higher is better)
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance
- **Elbow Method**: Finding the optimal number of clusters visually

## 💡 Key Concepts to Master

- **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean, Manhattan, and other similarity measures
- **Centroid Calculation**: How cluster centers are determined
- **Cluster Validation**: Assessing clustering quality
- **Dendrograms**: Reading and interpreting hierarchical cluster trees
- **Linkage Methods**: Complete, average, single, and Ward linkage

## 🎯 Business Applications
