# 🎓 Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs to find patterns and relationships.

## 📚 What is Supervised Learning?

In supervised learning, we have:
- **Input features (X)**: The data we use to make predictions
- **Target labels (Y)**: The correct answers we want to predict
- **Goal**: Learn a function f(X) = Y that can predict labels for new data

## 🎯 Types of Supervised Learning

### 🔢 Regression
**Predicting continuous numerical values**

Examples: Predicting house prices, stock prices, temperature, sales revenue

**Algorithms in this section:**
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Basic linear relationship between one feature and target
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Linear relationship with multiple features
- **Polynomial Regression**: Non-linear relationships using polynomial features
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: SVM adapted for regression tasks
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Tree-based approach for regression
- **Random Forest Regression**: Ensemble of decision trees

### 🏷️ Classification
**Predicting categorical labels or classes**

Examples: Email spam detection, image recognition, medical diagnosis, customer churn

**Algorithms in this section:**
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear approach for binary/multi-class classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: Classification based on similarity to neighbors
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Finding optimal decision boundaries
- **Kernel SVM**: SVM with non-linear decision boundaries
- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
- **Decision Tree Classification**: Tree-based decision making
- **Random Forest Classification**: Ensemble of decision trees

## 🔄 Supervised Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather labeled training data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose relevant input features
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate algorithm
5. **Training**: Fit the model to training data
6. **Evaluation**: Test performance on validation/test data
7. **Prediction**: Use trained model on new data

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

### For Regression:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared difference
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **R² Score**: Coefficient of determination

### For Classification:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Table showing prediction results
