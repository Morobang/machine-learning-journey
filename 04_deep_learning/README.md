# 🧠 Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. Inspired by the human brain's structure, deep learning has revolutionized fields like computer vision, natural language processing, and many others.

## 🎯 What is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning uses **artificial neural networks** with multiple hidden layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Unlike traditional machine learning that requires manual feature engineering, deep learning automatically discovers relevant features from raw data.

### **Key Components:**
- **Neurons**: Basic processing units that receive inputs and produce outputs
- **Layers**: Collections of neurons (input, hidden, output layers)
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters that the network learns during training
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions that help networks learn complex patterns
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for updating weights based on errors

## 🔄 How Deep Learning Works

1. **Forward Pass**: Data flows through network layers, each applying transformations
2. **Prediction**: Final layer produces predictions
3. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions with actual values
4. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients using backpropagation
5. **Weight Update**: Adjust weights to minimize loss
6. **Repeat**: Continue until network converges
