# üìù Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

## üéØ What is Natural Language Processing?

NLP combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning to help computers process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.

### **Key Components:**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into individual words or tokens
- **Feature Extraction**: Converting text into numerical representations
- **Language Understanding**: Extracting meaning from text
- **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined classes

## üîÑ NLP Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering text data from various sources
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalizing, and preparing text
3. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual units
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating numerical representations
5. **Model Training**: Teaching algorithms to understand patterns
6. **Evaluation**: Testing model performance on new text
7. **Application**: Deploying models for real-world use

## üõ†Ô∏è Text Preprocessing Techniques

### **Essential Preprocessing Steps:**

1. **Text Cleaning**:
   - Remove special characters and punctuation
   - Convert to lowercase for consistency
   - Handle contractions and abbreviations

2. **Tokenization**:
   - Split text into individual words
   - Handle whitespace and delimiters
   - Create word boundaries

3. **Stop Words Removal**:
   - Remove common words (the, and, is, etc.)
   - Focus on meaningful content words
   - Reduce noise in the data

4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**:
   - Reduce words to their root forms
   - "running" ‚Üí "run", "better" ‚Üí "good"
   - Normalize word variations

5. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Bag of Words**: Count frequency of each word
   - **TF-IDF**: Weight words by importance
   - **N-grams**: Consider word sequences
